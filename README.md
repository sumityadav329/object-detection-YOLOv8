# Object Detection with YOLOv8

This project demonstrates how to perform object detection using YOLOv8 with custom data. YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art deep learning model for real-time object detection.

## FYI 
- This notebook is prepared by me in Google Collab using free t4 gpu.
- I uploaded the data on Google Drive and used it by mounting the drive into the collab.
- Custom Data used in the notebook `Object_detection_YOLOv8.ipynb` attached to this repository as data.zip file.

This is the result: 
Note: it may be less accurate becuase of small size of dataset and less no. of epochs during training.
